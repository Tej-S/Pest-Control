{"name":"Pest Control","body":"<h2>Pest Control</h2>\r\n<h4>6.832 Spring 2012 Project Proposal<br>\r\nStanislav Nikolov<br>\r\nApril 2, 2012<br><br></h4>\r\n\r\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nIn late 2011, Marras and Porﬁri [1] experimented with putting a robotic ﬁsh alongside real ﬁsh in a water tunnel. What they found was surprising. When the robotic ﬁsh beat its tail quickly enough, the real ﬁsh were attracted to it and began swimming in its wake. In this case, they managed to aﬀect the dynamics of a passive, self-organizing system using an active, deliberately controlled agent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI plan to study the properties of a class of multi-agent dynamical systems composed of a combination of passive and active agents. Active agents are agents with “active dynamics,” which we can directly aﬀect via input. Passive agents are agents with “passive dynamics,” which we cannot directly affect via input. Some examples include\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Flocking (for suitable choices of the dynamics). Every agent is passive and has dynamics that encourage cohesion, separation and alignment.</li>\r\n<li>Flocking with a mix of passive and active agents, where the active dynamics are just prescribed trajectories. A particular situation of interest is that in which the passive dynamics attempt to keep the ﬂock together while the active agents attempt to lead or shape it.</li>\r\n<li>Single-lane traﬃc smoothing. Passive, or “regular” cars go as fast as possible while avoiding collision. Active, or “smart” cars anticipate traﬃc shocks by communicating with other leader cars ahead and change their speed less drastically (according to an adjustable parameter) to dissipate shocks.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy main focus will be to understand how the addition of active agents subject to particular control policies can aﬀect properties of the all-passive system. In particular, I would like to know to what extent we can qualitatively change the properties of the previously passive system. Some natural questions are:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Does the passive system have ﬁxed points? If so, how do those change with the addition of active agents? If some points are unstable, can active agents help to stabilize them?</li>\r\n<li>Does the passive system have limit cycles? If not, can active agents with certain dynamics induce limit cycles? Are the limit cycles stable? If not, can we stabilize them?</li>\r\n<li>In what sense (if any) is the passive-active system controllable?</li>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy ﬁrst goal will be to ﬁnd simple systems for which these questions are interesting and, hopefully, mathematically tractable. I will also use extensive simulations for exploration and insight.\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>References</h3>\r\n[1] Marras, S., and Porfiri, M.
